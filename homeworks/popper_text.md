In "Conjectures and Refutations," Karl Popper examines the nature of scientific theories and how they differ from pseudo-scientific ideas. He argues that the key criterion distinguishing science is *falsifiability*: a theory must be testable and capable of being proven wrong by evidence. Popper critiques theories like Marxism and psychoanalysis, which, according to him, lack this quality since they can accommodate any outcome as confirmation. In contrast, scientific theories, such as Einstein's theory of relativity, are structured in a way that specific, risky predictions can be tested and potentially refuted. For Popper, science progresses through bold conjectures and rigorous attempts to refute them, while theories that cannot be tested or falsified fall outside the realm of science. This framework became known as Popper's "demarcation problem," aimed at separating scientific knowledge from metaphysics and pseudo-science.
