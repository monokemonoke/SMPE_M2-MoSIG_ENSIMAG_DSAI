## Simple Linear Regression
- the birth of "regression"
    - 19 century
    - Galton
    - investigate the relationship between the size of head and the ability of math.
- What is a regression
    - prediction
    - assessment of the effect or relationship
    - general description of data structure
    - detect what does not behave as expected
        - interesting
- difference between statistics and probabilities
    - data
        - produced by measurements
    - deterministic statistics
        - just summarizing the data
    - probabilitic model
    - inferential statistic
- Least Squarer Line
    - Why we use $\sum (y_i - (\alpha + \beta x_i))^2$
        - because F is quadratic in $\alpha$ and in $\beta$.
        - If we simply differentiate F by $\alpha$ and by $\beta$, we can obtain a closed form for the minimum.


## Linear Model
<!-- variability of the system -->
- Linear Model
- Hopothesis
    - the predictor variables X can be treated as fixed.
    - linearity.
        beaware of overfitting
    - independance of errors
    - homoscedasticity
        variance
    - normal and iid errors
    - arrangement of the predictor variables
        - if you want to test linearity, X should be uniformly distributed
        - if you want the best estimation, you should use extreme values of X
    - residual study
        - e.g. sociology
- Goodness of fit measure: R^2
    $$
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}(x_i))^2 }{ \sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2 }
    $$
- confidence interval

# Sicentific Publicasion and Sicentific Integrity

## Of publications and knowledge

- journals as a way to build knowledge
    - started in 1665
        - Paris: Journal des scavans
        - London: Philosophical Transactions of the royal ...
    - aim:
        - written by and for specialists
        - cites
    - traditional, gold open access

## Different kinds of venue
- accounting units    

- analyze
    - not to focus on the details
    - not to be critical
    - cite
    - what was new
    - add a short reaction to the papers.
